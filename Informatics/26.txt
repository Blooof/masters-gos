PESA-II (Pareto Envelope-Based Selection Algorithm II): (Annotation) We describe a new selection technique for evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms in which the unit of selection is a hyperbox in objective space. In this technique, instead of assigning a selective fitness to an individual, selective fitness is assigned to the hyperboxes in objective space which are currently occupied by at least one individual in the current approximation to the Pareto frontier. A hyperbox is thereby selected, and the resulting selected individual is randomly chosen from this hyperbox. This method of selection is shown to be more sensitive to ensuring a good spread of development along the Pareto frontier than individualbased selection. The method is implemented in a modern multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, and performance is tested by using Deb's test suite of `T' functions with varying properties. The new selection technique is found to give significantly superior results to the other methods compared, namely PAES, PESA, and SPEA; each is a modern multiobjective optimization algorithm previously found to outperform earlier approaches on various problems.
